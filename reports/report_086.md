## 1. Introduction: Why Hollow Shafts Matter for NEV Electric Drives

### 1.1 The Strategic Importance of Motor Shaft Manufacturing

The motor shaft represents one of the most critical components in NEV electric drive units, serving as the mechanical backbone that transmits torque from the electric motor to the drivetrain. Unlike conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, NEV electric motors operate at significantly higher rotational speeds (8,000-20,000 RPM versus 2,000-6,000 RPM for ICE) and face demanding requirements for efficiency, NVH (noise, vibration, harshness) performance, and reliability over 100,000+ mile service life.

The shift from solid to hollow motor shafts in NEV applications represents a fundamental design evolution driven by three compelling factors:

**1. Weight Reduction**: Hollow shafts reduce rotating mass by 20-30% compared to solid shafts of equivalent strength, directly improving motor response and energy efficiency. According to [Automotive Drive Shaft Market Analysis](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/automotive-drive-shaft-market), hollow shafts now command **57.12% market share** in the automotive drive shaft segment due to their optimal balance of weight reduction and cost efficiency.

**2. Cooling Integration**: Modern NEV motors increasingly use oil-cooled designs where coolant circulates through hollow shaft passages directly to the rotor, enabling higher power density without thermal limitations. As noted by [Schaeffler at bauma 2025](https://www.schaeffler.com/en/media/press-releases/press-releases-detail.jsp?id=88087361), oil-cooled hollow shaft designs with internal passages for cooling oil circulation have become standard for high-performance applications.

**3. Material Efficiency**: Stress analysis demonstrates that motor shafts are not strength-limited by hollow geometry—the critical stresses occur at the outer surface where both solid and hollow sections provide equivalent material. This means hollow designs deliver the same structural performance with 25-40% less material.

### 1.2 NEV-Specific Requirements That Drive Manufacturing Choices

NEV motor shafts face unique technical demands that constrain manufacturing process selection:

**High-Speed Operation**: EV motors routinely operate at 12,000-20,000 RPM, generating centrifugal stresses of 180-220 MPa at typical shaft diameters according to [Materials Analysis research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352492824006841). This demands:
- Tight concentricity (TIR 0.01-0.03mm) to prevent dynamic imbalance
- High fatigue strength to withstand 10^8+ load cycles over vehicle lifetime
- Consistent material properties with no internal defects

**Tight Tolerances**: Motor efficiency depends critically on air gap between rotor and stator, typically 0.5-1.0mm. Shaft dimensional variation directly impacts air gap consistency, requiring:
- Bearing journal tolerances of ±0.01-0.02mm
- Surface finish Ra 0.4-0.8 µm for bearing interfaces
- Runout less than 0.03mm over shaft length

**High Torque Transmission**: Electric motors deliver peak torque instantaneously, subjecting shafts to severe torsional loads. This requires:
- Case-hardened surfaces (58-62 HRC) for spline and coupling interfaces
- Tough core material to resist shock loads
- Favorable grain flow orientation for fatigue resistance

### 1.3 The Manufacturing Decision: Why Process Selection Matters

Selecting the right manufacturing process for hollow motor shafts represents a strategic decision with 5-10 year implications. According to [Break-Even Analysis for Manufacturers](https://www.chortek.com/blog/break-even-analysis-best-practice-manufacturers/), process investments in forming equipment (flow forming, radial forging) typically depreciate over 7-10 years, creating long-term commitment to a particular production strategy.

The decision involves balancing multiple factors:

| Factor | Impact | Key Trade-off |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Production Volume | Determines capital investment feasibility | High volume favors forming; low volume favors machining |
| Material Cost | 40-60% of total shaft cost | Forming processes achieve 90-98% utilization vs. 30-55% for machining |
| Lead Time | Affects inventory carrying cost and flexibility | Forming: 3-5 days; Forging: 8-15 days |
| Quality Requirements | Determines acceptable defect rates | Forming achieves 96-99% first-pass yield vs. 92-96% for machining |
| Capital Availability | Constrains equipment investment options | Flow forming: $2-3.5M; Radial forging: $4-10M |

## 3. Material-Process Compatibility Analysis

Selecting the right material-process combination is critical for NEV motor shaft performance. This section examines which steel grades work with which forming processes and explains the underlying metallurgical reasons.

### 3.1 Steel Grades Used for NEV Motor Shafts

#### 3.1.1 Case-Hardening Steels (Primary Choice for Most Applications)

Case-hardening steels are designed to develop a hard, wear-resistant surface through carburizing while maintaining a tough, ductile core. According to [Case-hardening Steel - thyssenkrupp](https://www.thyssenkrupp-steel.com/en/products/hot-strip/c-steel/case-hardening-steel/einsatzstahl.html), these steels contain 0.14-0.22% carbon with alloying elements that improve hardenability.

| Grade | Composition | Surface Hardness | Core Strength | NEV Application |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **16MnCr5** | 0.16%C, 1.1%Mn, 1.0%Cr | 58-62 HRC | 800-1100 MPa | Standard motor shafts |
| **20MnCr5** | 0.20%C, 1.25%Mn, 1.15%Cr | 58-62 HRC | 900-1200 MPa | Higher torque applications |
| **SAE 8620** | 0.20%C, 0.5%Ni, 0.5%Cr, 0.2%Mo | 58-62 HRC | 800-1100 MPa | Premium applications |
| **18CrNiMo7-6** | 0.18%C, 1.65%Ni, 1.65%Cr, 0.3%Mo | 58-63 HRC | 1100-1400 MPa | High-performance motors |

**Why Case-Hardening Steels Dominate NEV Applications**:

Case-hardening steels are preferred BECAUSE they address the dual demands of motor shafts: wear resistance at bearing and spline surfaces combined with toughness to resist shock loads. According to [Case-hardening Steel Carbodur - Swiss Steel](https://swisssteel-group.com/content-media/documents/Brochures/Engineering-Steel/053_DEW_Carbodur_GB.pdf), case hardening delivers:

- **Surface Hardness of 57-63 HRC**: Provides wear resistance at bearing journals where Hertzian contact stresses exceed 1,500 MPa
- **Case Depth of 0.8-1.5mm**: Sufficient to resist contact fatigue and surface pitting
- **Core Hardness of 30-40 HRC**: Maintains ductility and impact resistance
- **Fatigue Life Improvement of 2-3×**: The hard case resists crack initiation while tough core arrests propagation

---

#### 3.1.2 Through-Hardening Steels

Through-hardening steels achieve uniform hardness throughout the cross-section after quenching and tempering. They're used when consistent properties are needed or case hardening is impractical.

| Grade | Composition | Hardened Hardness | Tensile Strength | NEV Application |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **42CrMo4 / AISI 4140** | 0.42%C, 1.0%Cr, 0.2%Mo | 45-55 HRC | 1000-1200 MPa | High-torque shafts |
| **SAE 4340** | 0.40%C, 1.8%Ni, 0.8%Cr, 0.25%Mo | 45-55 HRC | 1200-1500 MPa | Premium performance |
| **34CrNiMo6** | 0.34%C, 1.5%Ni, 1.5%Cr, 0.2%Mo | 42-50 HRC | 1100-1300 MPa | Large diameter shafts |

**When Through-Hardening is Preferred**:

Through-hardening steels are selected when:
1. Wall sections are thin (< 10mm) making case hardening impractical
2. Entire cross-section experiences high stress (no benign core region)
3. Induction hardening will be used for localized surface hardening after through-hardening

### 3.2 Process-Material Compatibility Matrix

Not all forming processes work equally well with all steel grades. The following matrix summarizes compatibility based on formability, temperature requirements, and final property development.

| Steel Grade | Flow Forming | Radial Forging | Cold Heading | Hydroforming | Gun Drilling |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **16MnCr5** | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ |
| **20MnCr5** | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ |

| **Aluminum 6061** | ★★★★★ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ |

**Legend**: ★★★★★ = Excellent, ★★★★☆ = Good, ★★★☆☆ = Moderate, ★★☆☆☆ = Difficult, ★☆☆☆☆ = Not Recommended

---

### 3.3 Why Certain Combinations Work Better

#### 3.3.1 Flow Forming + Case-Hardening Steels (★★★★★)

This combination excels BECAUSE case-hardening steels (16MnCr5, 20MnCr5) have low carbon content (0.14-0.22%) that provides excellent ductility for cold forming. According to research on flow forming, these steels can tolerate wall thickness reductions of 50-80% per pass without cracking.

**Key Benefits**:
- Low flow stress enables forming at moderate mandrel pressures
- Work hardening during forming increases surface hardness by 50-100 HB
- Retains sufficient ductility for subsequent case hardening
- Favorable grain flow orientation created during forming

**Process Parameters for 16MnCr5 Flow Forming**:
- Reduction per pass: 30-50% (can reach 60% with intermediate annealing)
- Forming speed: 0.5-3 mm/rev feed rate
- Mandrel surface: Hardened to 55-60 HRC
- Lubrication: High-pressure coolant with EP additives

---

#### 3.3.2 Radial Forging + All Steel Grades (★★★★★)

Radial forging works excellently with virtually all shaft steels BECAUSE the process operates at elevated temperatures (1,000-1,250°C) where even high-carbon, high-alloy steels become highly ductile. According to [GFM Radial Forging Technology](https://www.gfm.at/products/radial-forging-automotive/?lang=en), hot radial forging can process:

- Low-carbon case-hardening steels
- Medium-carbon through-hardening steels
- High-strength alloys (4340, 300M)
- Stainless steels and nickel alloys
- Titanium alloys (with appropriate die materials)

**Why Hot Working Enables Material Versatility**:
At forging temperatures, material flow stress drops by 80-90% compared to room temperature, allowing even difficult-to-form alloys to be shaped. The dynamic recrystallization that occurs during hot forging refines grain structure regardless of starting material condition.

---

#### 3.3.3 Cold Heading + Low-Carbon Steels (★★★★☆ to ★☆☆☆☆)

Cold heading compatibility decreases sharply with increasing carbon and alloy content BECAUSE these elements increase flow stress and decrease ductility at room temperature.

| Steel Type | Cold Heading Feasibility | Reason |
|------------|--------------------------|--------|
| 16MnCr5, 20MnCr5 | ★★★★☆ Excellent | Low carbon, moderate alloy |
| SAE 8620 | ★★★☆☆ Moderate | Nickel addition reduces ductility |
| 42CrMo4 | ★★☆☆☆ Difficult | Medium carbon increases cracking risk |
| SAE 4340 | ★☆☆☆☆ Not recommended | High alloy content, cracking likely |

**Tesla's Cold Heading Success**: According to [Tesla Cyberbeast Motor Teardown](https://leandesign.com/tesla-cyberbeast-motor-teardown-review/), Tesla uses cold heading successfully by carefully selecting appropriate steel grades (likely 10B21 or similar low-carbon boron steel) and optimizing die design to minimize strain concentrations.

---

### 3.4 How Forming Affects Material Properties

#### 3.4.1 Grain Flow and Fiber Orientation

Different forming processes create dramatically different grain structures that affect fatigue performance:

**Flow Forming and Cold Heading**:
Creates circumferential grain flow aligned with the principal stress direction in rotating shafts. According to [Flow Forming Technology research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652625003610), this favorable orientation improves:
- Fatigue strength by 30-50% compared to machined parts
- Resistance to torsional fatigue cracking
- Uniformity of mechanical properties around the circumference

**Radial Forging**:
Creates axial grain flow with grains elongated parallel to the shaft axis. This benefits:
- Bending fatigue resistance
- Axial load carrying capacity
- Uniformity along shaft length

**Machined Parts**:
Machining cuts through the natural grain flow, exposing grain boundaries at the surface. This reduces fatigue strength by 20-40% compared to formed parts with favorable fiber orientation.

---

#### 3.4.2 Work Hardening Effects

Cold forming processes (flow forming, cold heading, rotary swaging) increase surface hardness through work hardening:

| Process | Starting Hardness | Final Hardness | Hardness Increase |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Flow Forming | 150-180 HB | 220-280 HB | +50-100 HB |
| Cold Heading | 150-180 HB | 200-250 HB | +40-80 HB |
| Rotary Swaging | 150-180 HB | 210-260 HB | +50-90 HB |

**Benefit for NEV Shafts**: Work-hardened surfaces provide initial wear resistance without heat treatment, enabling stress relief annealing rather than full case hardening for some applications. This matters BECAUSE it reduces heat treatment time from 12-18 hours to 3-4 hours, directly cutting lead time and energy costs.

---

#### 3.4.3 Residual Stress Patterns

Forming processes induce residual stresses that significantly affect fatigue performance:

**Flow Forming**: Creates compressive residual stresses of 400-800 MPa at the surface. This is beneficial BECAUSE compressive surface stresses oppose the tensile stresses from bending and torsion that drive fatigue crack initiation. According to [Shot Peening research](https://superiorshotpeening.com/news/shot-peening-advantages), similar compressive stress levels from shot peening extend fatigue life by 2-5×.

**Radial Forging**: Hot forging followed by cooling creates complex residual stress patterns. Proper cooling controls (water spray vs. air cool) can be used to generate beneficial compression at critical surfaces.

**Machining**: Turning and grinding typically induce tensile residual stresses at the surface, which is detrimental to fatigue life. This is why machined shafts often require shot peening to restore compressive surface stresses.

---

### 3.5 NEV-Specific Material Requirements

#### 3.5.1 High-Speed Operation Demands

NEV motors operate at speeds 2-4× higher than ICE components, creating unique material challenges:

**Centrifugal Stress**: At 20,000 RPM with 50mm diameter, centrifugal stress reaches 180-220 MPa. Material yield strength must exceed this by at least 50% safety factor, requiring minimum yield strength of 330 MPa even before considering torque loads.

**Very-High-Cycle Fatigue**: NEV motor shafts experience 10^8+ cycles over vehicle lifetime (compared to 10^6-10^7 for ICE). Materials must exhibit excellent fatigue limit behavior, favoring:
- Fine grain structure (ASTM 7-8 or finer)
- Clean steel with low inclusion content
- Case-hardened surfaces for superior fatigue resistance

---

#### 3.5.2 Magnetic Property Considerations

Motor shafts in close proximity to electromagnetic fields may need controlled magnetic properties:

**Non-Magnetic Requirements**: Some shaft designs pass through magnetic flux paths and require low magnetic permeability (μr < 1.05) to avoid flux leakage. This restricts material choices to:
- Austenitic stainless steels (316L, 304)
- Certain nickel alloys
- Aluminum alloys

**Standard Applications**: Most NEV motor shafts use conventional carbon and alloy steels (ferritic/martensitic) where magnetic permeability is not a concern because the shaft is outside the primary flux path.

---

### 3.6 Material Selection Recommendations

| Application | Recommended Material | Recommended Process | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Standard NEV motor** | 16MnCr5 / 20MnCr5 | Flow Forming | Best cost-performance balance |
| **High-torque application** | 18CrNiMo7-6 | Radial Forging | Superior fatigue resistance |
| **Lightweight auxiliary motor** | 6061-T6 Aluminum | Flow Forming | 60% weight reduction |
| **High-speed premium** | SAE 4340 | Radial Forging | Maximum strength and toughness |
| **Cost-sensitive high-volume** | Low-carbon boron steel | Cold Heading | Minimum forming cost |

## 5. Post-Processing Requirements by Manufacturing Route

Post-processing operations often determine total manufacturing cost and lead time. A "cheaper" forming process may require extensive secondary operations that negate initial savings. This section details the complete processing sequence for each manufacturing route.

### 5.1 Heat Treatment Requirements

#### 5.1.1 Flow-Formed Shafts: Minimal Heat Treatment

Flow forming creates favorable microstructure through cold working, often requiring only stress relief:

| Heat Treatment | Temperature | Duration | Purpose |
|----------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Stress Relief** | 300-450°C | 2-4 hours | Remove residual stresses, stabilize dimensions |
| **Optional Induction Hardening** | 850-950°C (localized) | 5-15 seconds | Harden bearing journals and splines |

**Why Flow Forming Needs Less Heat Treatment**: According to [Flow Forming Technology - Leifeld](https://leifeldms.com/en/index.html), cold flow forming induces 30-40% wall thickness reduction with corresponding:
- 15-25% increase in yield strength through work hardening
- Surface hardness increase of 50-100 HB (from ~150 to 220-250 HB)
- Beneficial compressive residual stresses at the surface

**Cost Impact**: Heat treatment cost of **$1.50-3.00 per shaft** versus $8-15 for case hardening

---

#### 5.1.2 Forged Shafts: Comprehensive Heat Treatment Required

Forged hollow shafts universally require complete heat treatment cycles. According to [Metal Case Hardening - SST](https://www.sst.net/metal-case-hardening/):

| Treatment Stage | Temperature | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Normalizing** | 850-900°C | 1-2 hours | Refine as-forged grain structure |
| **Carburizing** | 900-950°C | 4-12 hours | Diffuse carbon into surface layer |
| **Quenching** | Oil at 60-80°C | 5-15 minutes | Harden the carbon-enriched case |
| **Tempering** | 150-200°C | 2-4 hours | Relieve quench stresses, restore toughness |

**Total Cycle Time**: **12-18 hours** (often batch processed overnight)

**Case Depth and Hardness**:
- Case depth: 0.8-1.5mm for typical NEV shafts
- Surface hardness: 58-62 HRC
- Core hardness: 30-40 HRC

**Post-Heat Treatment Distortion**: According to [Hollow Forging Manufacturing Process - CT Forge](https://www.creatorcomponents.com/news/hollow-forging-manufacturing-process-and-quality-control.html), quenching induces distortion of **0.5-2.0mm** in hollow shafts, necessitating:
- 2-6mm additional machining stock before hardening
- Straightening operations after hardening
- Hard machining to final dimensions

---

### 5.2 Machining Requirements

#### 5.2.1 Flow-Formed Shafts: 2-4 Operations

## 9. Conclusion

### 9.1 Key Findings Summary

This comprehensive analysis of hollow motor shaft manufacturing technologies for NEV electric drive units yields the following principal conclusions:

**1. Flow Forming is the Optimal Process for Most NEV Applications**

Flow forming delivers the best combination of cost, quality, and scalability for standard NEV motor shafts at volumes exceeding 15,000 units annually. The process achieves 93-98% material utilization, near-net-shape accuracy requiring minimal post-processing, and favorable grain structure that improves fatigue resistance by 25-40% compared to machined alternatives.

**2. Material Utilization is the Dominant Cost Driver**

The 50-70 percentage point difference in material utilization between forming processes (90-98%) and machining (30-55%) creates cost differentials of $15-40 per shaft that persist regardless of volume. At 100,000 annual units, this translates to $1.5-4.0 million in material cost savings alone—dwarfing other cost factors.

**3. Industry Leaders Have Validated These Conclusions**

Major NEV manufacturers and Tier 1 suppliers have converged on forming-based production:
- Tesla pioneered cold heading for motor shafts, achieving 30-40% cost reduction
- BYD operates at 97% automation producing 850,000+ shafts monthly
- ZF, BorgWarner, Nidec, and Schaeffler all manufacture hollow motor shafts in-house using forming processes

**4. Post-Processing Requirements Vary Dramatically by Forming Method**

The initial forming process is only part of the cost equation:
- Flow-formed shafts require 6-8 operations over 3-5 days
- Forged shafts require 12-15 operations over 8-15 days
- CNC machined shafts require 10-14 operations over 6-12 days

**5. Process Selection Creates Long-Term Strategic Commitment**

Manufacturing process investments typically depreciate over 7-10 years, making process selection a strategic bet on production volume and market evolution. Under-estimating volume leads to excessive per-unit costs, while over-investing in forming capacity for low volumes destroys ROI.

---

### 9.2 Strategic Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommended Action | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **New NEV program, uncertain volume** | Start with contract flow forming | Validate process, minimize risk |
| **Established production, 25K+ units/year** | Invest in captive flow forming | ROI in 18-30 months, 30% cost reduction |
| **Premium/high-performance application** | Consider radial forging | Superior mechanical properties justify premium |
| **Ultra-high volume (100K+)** | Automated flow forming or cold heading | Industry-leading cost position |
| **Prototype/development** | CNC machining | Maximum flexibility, fastest samples |

---

### 9.3 Answering the Original Research Questions

**Q: What are all the current forming techniques for hollow motor shafts?**

A: Thirteen distinct techniques across seven categories: Flow forming, rotary swaging (rotary/spinning), radial forging, precision hot forging (forging), tube hydroforming (hydroforming), hot extrusion, cold extrusion/heading (extrusion), gun drilling, BTA drilling, CNC from tube (machining), friction welding, laser welding (joining), and emerging techniques including three-roll skew rolling and additive manufacturing.

**Q: How do they compare on material compatibility?**

A: Case-hardening steels (16MnCr5, 20MnCr5, SAE 8620) work excellently with flow forming and cold heading due to their low carbon content and high ductility. Higher-alloy and higher-carbon steels (42CrMo4, SAE 4340) require hot processing (radial forging) due to limited cold formability. Aluminum alloys work well with most forming processes.

**Q: How do they compare on cost-effectiveness?**

A: At volumes exceeding 15,000 units/year, flow forming delivers the lowest total cost at approximately $33-40/part. CNC machining costs $48-50/part regardless of volume due to persistent material waste and labor intensity. Radial forging costs $42-50/part but delivers superior mechanical properties.

**Q: What post-processing is required?**

A: Flow-formed shafts require stress relief (3-4 hours), minimal machining (8-20 minutes), and optional induction hardening. Forged shafts require complete case hardening (12-18 hours), extensive machining (60-135 minutes), and multiple finishing operations. Post-processing can represent 35-60% of total manufacturing cost.

**Q: Which routes are most suitable for NEV applications?**

A: **Flow forming** for standard motor shafts at volume (15,000+ units), **radial forging** for premium/high-performance applications, **cold heading** for ultra-high volume small-diameter shafts, and **CNC machining** for prototypes and low volumes (< 5,000 units).

---

### 9.4 Final Remarks

The hollow motor shaft represents a critical component where manufacturing process selection directly impacts NEV competitiveness. The convergence of industry leaders on forming-based production—flow forming, radial forging, and cold heading—reflects the compelling economics of near-net-shape manufacturing compared to traditional machining approaches.

For manufacturers entering or expanding NEV production, investing in flow forming capability represents not an optional optimization but a competitive necessity. The 30-50% total cost advantage over machining alternatives compounds across production volumes, creating structural cost disadvantage for competitors who delay this investment.

The evidence strongly supports immediate action to establish forming capability, whether through contract manufacturing partnerships or captive equipment investment, depending on volume projections and capital availability. The window for building manufacturing advantage remains open, but leaders like Tesla and BYD have already established the benchmark that others must meet or exceed.
