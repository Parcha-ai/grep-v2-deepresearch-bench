# Transgender Representations in Middle Eastern and North African Cinema: A Transnational Analysis of Gender, Identity, and Postcolonial Critique

## Abstract

This paper examines the representation of transgender identities in cinema from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), analyzing how filmmakers negotiate between Western transgender frameworks, indigenous conceptualizations of gender variance, and the constraints of regional censorship regimes. Through close analysis of three films—*Be Like Others* (Tanaz Eshaghian, 2008), *Facing Mirrors* (Negar Azarbayjani, 2011), and *Zenne Dancer* (Caner Alper and Mehmet Binay, 2012)—this study interrogates the applicability of Euro-American trans theory to MENA contexts while examining how cinema serves as a site for negotiating gender non-conformity across cultural boundaries. Drawing on transgender studies, postcolonial film theory, and regional scholarship on gender variance in Islamic societies, this analysis reveals how MENA transgender cinema both appropriates and resists Western identity categories, navigating what Joseph Massad has termed the "Gay International" while articulating distinctly local understandings of gender transgression.

## I. Introduction

The emergence of transgender-themed cinema from the Middle East and North Africa presents a compelling case study in transnational identity politics and the limits of Western theoretical frameworks. While transgender studies has developed primarily within Euro-American academic contexts—shaped by the work of scholars such as Judith Butler, Susan Stryker, and Sandy Stone—the representation of gender-variant individuals in MENA cinema challenges the universality of these frameworks, revealing the culturally contingent nature of gender categories themselves.

Iran occupies a paradoxical position within this landscape. As a theocratic state that criminalizes homosexuality with penalties up to death, Iran simultaneously permits and even subsidizes gender reassignment surgery following Ayatollah Khomeini's 1987 fatwa declaring such procedures religiously permissible for "diagnosed transsexuals" ([Human Rights Watch, 2010](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/15/we-are-justice-and-order/irans-hidden-transgender-victims)). This creates what scholars have termed a "legal paradox" wherein transgender identity is medicalized and legitimized while same-sex desire remains criminalized—a configuration that produces complex pressures on gender-nonconforming individuals and generates distinctive cinematic representations.

The scholarly significance of MENA transgender cinema lies not merely in its documentary or representational value, but in how it exposes the fault lines between competing conceptualizations of gender, sexuality, and identity. These films circulate through international film festivals, reaching audiences who may interpret them through Western frameworks of LGBTQ+ liberation, while simultaneously addressing domestic audiences navigating vastly different legal and social contexts. This transnational circulation raises crucial questions: How do filmmakers negotiate between local and global understandings of gender variance? What role does cinema play in either reinforcing or disrupting dominant narratives about transgender identity? And how might postcolonial critique illuminate the power dynamics embedded in the very categories through which we understand gender transgression?

This paper proceeds in five parts. Following this introduction, Section II establishes the theoretical framework, synthesizing insights from transgender studies, queer cinema theory, and postcolonial critique. Section III provides essential context on gender variance in MENA societies, examining both historical Islamic conceptualizations (such as *khuntha* and *mukhannathun*) and contemporary legal-medical frameworks. Section IV offers close analyses of three films that exemplify different modes of representing transgender experience in the region. Section V concludes by theorizing what MENA transgender cinema contributes to broader debates about gender, representation, and the politics of visibility.

## II. Theoretical Framework

### A. Transgender Studies: Western Foundations and Their Limits

Contemporary transgender studies emerged from the intersection of feminist theory, queer studies, and activist scholarship in the 1990s, fundamentally challenging binary understandings of sex and gender. Judith Butler's *Gender Trouble* (1990) provided a foundational theoretical intervention through the concept of gender performativity—the argument that gender is not an expression of an inner essence but rather constituted through repeated stylized acts that create the illusion of a stable gender identity ([Butler, 1990](https://www.routledge.com/Gender-Trouble-Feminism-and-the-Subversion-of-Identity/Butler/p/book/9780415389556)). Butler's work destabilized the sex/gender distinction that had organized feminist thought, suggesting that sex itself is discursively constructed rather than biologically given.

Susan Stryker's foundational essay "(De)Subjugated Knowledges" (2006) defined transgender studies as concerned with "anything that disrupts, denaturalizes, rearticulates, and makes visible the normative linkages we generally assume to exist between the biological specificity of the sexually differentiated human body, the social roles and statuses that a particular form of body is expected to occupy, the subjectively experienced relationship between a gendered sense of self and social expectations of gender-role performance" ([Stryker, 2006](https://read.dukeupress.edu/tsq/article/1/1-2/1/91829/De-SubjugatedKnowledges-An-Introduction-to)). This capacious definition has enabled transgender studies to encompass diverse forms of gender variance across cultures and historical periods.

Yet the field has also been marked by productive internal tensions. Jay Prosser's *Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality* (1998) offered a crucial counterpoint to Butler's emphasis on performativity, arguing for the phenomenological significance of embodiment and the felt need for bodily transformation among transsexual individuals ([Prosser, 1998](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/second-skins/9780231109345)). Prosser critiques what he sees as queer theory's appropriation of transgender experience as metaphor for gender instability, insisting on the material specificity of transsexual embodiment.

Sandy Stone's "The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttranssexual Manifesto" (1991) remains foundational for its call to move beyond medicalized narratives of "wrong body" transsexualism toward more complex accounts of transgender subjectivity ([Stone, 1991](https://uberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trans-manifesto.pdf)). Stone argues that the requirement to produce coherent gender narratives for medical gatekeepers has constrained transgender self-representation, calling instead for "posttranssexual" accounts that embrace contradiction and multiplicity.

Viviane Namaste's *Invisible Lives: The Erasure of Transsexual and Transgendered People* (2000) offers essential critique of academic transgender studies' tendency toward abstraction, arguing for attention to the concrete material conditions—employment, housing, healthcare access—that shape transgender lives ([Namaste, 2000](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo3631006.html)). This emphasis on lived experience provides crucial grounding for analysis of transgender representation in cinema.

Jack Halberstam's work on "queer time and space" theorizes how gender-nonconforming subjects inhabit temporality and geography differently from normative subjects, developing alternative life narratives outside heteronormative frameworks of reproduction and generational succession ([Halberstam, 2005](https://www.dukeupress.edu/in-a-queer-time-and-place)). This concept proves particularly generative for analyzing how MENA transgender cinema represents characters' navigation of familial and social time.

### B. Queer Cinema Theory and the Politics of Representation

The theoretical frameworks developed for analyzing LGBTQ+ cinema provide essential tools for understanding transgender representation, while also requiring critical adaptation. B. Ruby Rich's concept of "New Queer Cinema" identified an early-1990s wave of films characterized by formal innovation and unapologetic queerness, though trans-specific representation remained marginal within this formation ([Rich, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1212781)). The New Queer Cinema prioritized style and affect over positive representation, challenging earlier demands for "good" images of homosexuality.

Laura Mulvey's foundational essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975) theorized the "male gaze" structuring classical Hollywood cinema, whereby the camera adopts a masculine heterosexual perspective that objectifies women as spectacle ([Mulvey, 1975](https://www.jstor.org/stable/778526)). Subsequent scholars have adapted Mulvey's framework to analyze how transgender bodies are similarly positioned as objects of spectacle, often through what has been termed the "reveal trope"—narrative moments that expose transgender characters' bodies as sites of revelation and frequently horror.

Teresa de Lauretis's concept of "technologies of gender" (1987) theorizes gender not as natural property but as product of various social technologies—cinema prominently among them—that construct and regulate gendered subjectivity ([de Lauretis, 1987](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1354430)). De Lauretis argues that representation is not merely reflective but productive of gender, making cinema analysis crucial for understanding how gender categories are constituted and contested.

Richard Dyer's work on the politics of representation examines how minority groups are constructed through visual media, arguing for attention to patterns of representation that consistently position certain groups as deviant, dangerous, or pathetic ([Dyer, 2002](https://www.routledge.com/The-Matter-of-Images-Essays-on-Representation/Dyer/p/book/9780415254953)). Dyer's framework enables analysis of how transgender characters in MENA cinema are positioned relative to normative gender and sexuality.

The "reveal trope" in transgender cinema—whereby a character's transgender status is disclosed as narrative climax, often accompanied by visual exposure of the body—has received substantial critical attention. Julia Serano's work on "transmisogyny" examines how trans women are particularly subject to this trope, positioned as objects of deception ([Serano, 2007](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/julia-serano/whipping-girl/9781580056229/)). Analysis of MENA transgender films reveals complex negotiations with this convention, sometimes reproducing it while at other moments developing alternative representational strategies.

### C. Postcolonial Critique and the "Gay International"

Postcolonial theory provides essential tools for interrogating the power dynamics embedded in the transnational circulation of gender and sexual identity categories. Joseph Massad's *Desiring Arabs* (2007) offers the most sustained critique of what he terms the "Gay International"—the network of Western LGBTQ+ organizations, academics, and activists who, according to Massad, impose Western sexual identity categories onto Arab societies, thereby producing the very identities they claim merely to recognize ([Massad, 2007](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo5132840.html)).

Massad argues that prior to Western intervention, same-sex practices in Arab societies existed without necessitating homosexual or heterosexual identities. The importation of the homo/hetero binary through colonial modernity and its contemporary perpetuation through NGOs and human rights discourse has, Massad contends, paradoxically increased persecution by creating new categories of criminal identity. While Massad focuses primarily on sexual orientation rather than gender identity, his framework has significant implications for understanding transgender representation in MENA cinema, raising questions about whether films that adopt Western transgender categories participate in a similar colonial dynamic.

Jasbir Puar's *Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times* (2007) develops the concept of "homonationalism" to describe how certain Western states have incorporated selective LGBTQ+ acceptance into nationalist projects, positioning sexual progressivism as marker of civilization against the purported homophobia of Muslim societies ([Puar, 2007](https://www.dukeupress.edu/terrorist-assemblages)). Puar's analysis illuminates how MENA transgender cinema circulating in Western film festivals may be read through homonationalist frames that position the films' home countries as sites of barbaric oppression requiring Western intervention or enlightenment.

Ella Shohat and Robert Stam's *Unthinking Eurocentrism* (1994) provides comprehensive critique of how colonial and neocolonial power relations are embedded in media representation, calling for "polycentric" approaches that decenter Western perspectives ([Shohat & Stam, 1994](https://www.routledge.com/Unthinking-Eurocentrism-Multiculturalism-and-the-Media/Shohat-Stam/p/book/9780415063258)). Their analysis of the "ethnographic gaze" in Western cinema—the positioning of non-Western subjects as objects of anthropological curiosity—proves relevant for understanding how MENA transgender films may be consumed by Western audiences.

Hamid Naficy's concept of "accented cinema" theorizes films made by diasporic, exilic, and postcolonial filmmakers as constituting a distinct mode of production and aesthetics characterized by "tactile epistemics" and negotiation between home and host cultures ([Naficy, 2001](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691043913/an-accented-cinema)). Several significant MENA transgender films are made by diasporic filmmakers for international festival circuits, positioning them within Naficy's framework.

Jin Haritaworn's work on "trans necropolitics" examines how transgender bodies—particularly racialized transgender bodies—are deployed in Western discourse as evidence of the barbarism of non-Western cultures, erasing the violence transgender people face within Western societies while justifying military and political intervention abroad ([Haritaworn, 2015](https://www.dukeupress.edu/queer-lovers-and-hateful-others)). This framework proves essential for analyzing the reception contexts through which MENA transgender cinema circulates.

### D. Synthesis: Toward a Transnational Transgender Cinema Studies

This paper synthesizes these theoretical strands to develop an analytical framework attuned to both the specific dynamics of transgender representation and the postcolonial contexts through which MENA cinema is produced and consumed. Such an approach requires holding multiple tensions simultaneously: between transgender studies' attention to the specificity of gender variance and postcolonial critique's suspicion of universalizing Western categories; between cinema's role in constituting gender (per de Lauretis) and its potential to challenge hegemonic gender formations; between the importance of transgender visibility and the risks that visibility entails in contexts of persecution.

Central to this framework is attention to what might be termed "translation dynamics"—the processes through which concepts, identities, and representations move across cultural and linguistic boundaries, transforming in the process. MENA transgender cinema does not simply apply Western transgender categories or reject them wholesale, but rather negotiates between multiple frameworks in ways that may produce novel configurations of gender, sexuality, and identity.

## III. Gender Variance in MENA Societies: Historical and Contemporary Contexts

### A. Islamic Jurisprudential Categories: Khuntha and Mukhannathun

To understand transgender representation in MENA cinema, it is essential to establish the pre-existing cultural and religious frameworks through which gender variance has been conceptualized in the region. These frameworks differ substantially from Western transgender categories, revealing the culturally specific nature of gender systems while also illuminating points of potential translation and disjuncture.

Classical Islamic jurisprudence (*fiqh*) developed the category of *khuntha* to address individuals whose biological sex was ambiguous or indeterminate. The term derives from the Arabic root meaning "to be soft" or "to be effeminate," and the *khuntha* was conceptualized primarily in terms of physical anatomy rather than gender identity in the contemporary Western sense ([Rowson, 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/163657)). Islamic legal scholars distinguished between the *khuntha mushkil* (the "problematic" or ambiguous case) whose sex could not be definitively determined, and cases where sex could eventually be assigned based on which genitalia predominated or through which opening the individual urinated.

The jurisprudential treatment of *khuntha* reveals a binary logic operating beneath apparent accommodation of ambiguity. Legal scholars sought to classify the *khuntha* as ultimately male or female for purposes of inheritance, prayer positioning, marriage, and other gendered domains of law. As Paula Sanders argues in her analysis of medieval Islamic legal texts, "the khuntha was always, ideally, resolvable" into one binary category or the other ([Sanders, 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/163656)). This framework differs fundamentally from contemporary Western concepts of non-binary gender identity, as it conceptualized ambiguity as problem requiring resolution rather than legitimate subject position.

The *mukhannathun* (singular: *mukhannath*) represented a different category—typically understood as male-bodied individuals who adopted feminine dress, mannerisms, and social roles. Historical accounts from the early Islamic period document the presence of *mukhannathun* in Medina during the Prophet's time, where they served as musicians, entertainers, and intermediaries between gendered social spaces ([Rowson, 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/163657)). Early sources suggest ambivalence rather than uniform condemnation: some *mukhannathun* were tolerated or even valued for their social functions, while others faced punishment.

Everett Rowson's scholarship on *mukhannathun* in medieval Islamic societies reveals the complexity of gender/sexuality intersections in these frameworks. The *mukhannath* was defined primarily through behavioral femininity rather than sexual object choice, though later sources increasingly associated the category with male homosexuality ([Rowson, 1991](https://www.jstor.org/stable/163657)). This differs from contemporary Western distinctions between gender identity (transgender) and sexual orientation (gay/bisexual), suggesting different configurations of the relationship between gender expression, bodily sex, and desire.

Afsaneh Najmabadi's work on gender and sexuality in Iran provides crucial historical context for understanding contemporary transgender politics in that country. In *Women with Mustaches and Men without Beards: Gender and Sexual Anxieties of Iranian Modernity* (2005), Najmabadi traces how nineteenth and twentieth-century modernization produced new configurations of gender and sexuality, including the importation of European concepts of homosexuality as identity category ([Najmabadi, 2005](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520242630/women-with-mustaches-and-men-without-beards)). Prior to this transformation, Najmabadi argues, gender and sexuality were organized differently, with the amrad (beardless youth) occupying a position of legitimate erotic object choice for adult men without constituting a distinct sexual identity.

### B. Iran's Legal Paradox: The Khomeini Fatwa and State-Sanctioned Transition

Iran's unique legal framework for transgender individuals stems from a 1987 fatwa issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini permitting sex reassignment surgery for individuals diagnosed with "gender identity disorder." This fatwa has produced what scholars describe as a "legal paradox" wherein transgender identity is medicalized and legitimized while same-sex desire remains criminalized under Islamic law ([Bucar & Shirazi, 2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15570274.2012.706752)).

The origins of this fatwa trace to the case of Maryam Khatoon Molkara, a trans woman who sought religious authorization for her gender transition. After persistent advocacy including a personal audience with Khomeini, Molkara received the religious leader's endorsement for sex reassignment surgery, which was subsequently institutionalized as state policy ([Bucar & Shirazi, 2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15570274.2012.706752)). Iran has since developed an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus for authorizing and facilitating gender transition, including psychological evaluation, hormone therapy, and subsidized surgery.

The implications of this framework are deeply ambivalent. On one hand, Iran has become one of the world's leading countries for sex reassignment surgeries, with estimates suggesting between 150-300 procedures annually ([Human Rights Watch, 2010](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/15/we-are-justice-and-order/irans-hidden-transgender-victims)). Transgender individuals can obtain new identity documents reflecting their transitioned gender and are legally recognized in their new sex for purposes of marriage and other legal matters.

On the other hand, this legal recognition operates through a strictly medicalized framework that requires diagnosis of gender identity disorder and completion of full surgical transition. The framework leaves no space for non-binary identities, non-operative transgender individuals, or gender fluidity. More troublingly, Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented cases of gay and lesbian Iranians pressured to undergo gender transition as a means of "legitimizing" their same-sex desires through transformation into the "opposite" sex ([Human Rights Watch, 2010](https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/12/15/we-are-justice-and-order/irans-hidden-transgender-victims)).

This coercive dimension must be understood within the broader context of Iran's criminalization of homosexuality. Same-sex acts between men (*lavat*) and between women (*mosaheqeh*) are punishable under Iranian law, with penalties ranging from flogging to execution for repeat offenders. Within this legal regime, gender transition may appear as the only legitimate path for individuals experiencing same-sex desire—a path that brings them into conformity with heteronormative marriage while erasing homosexuality as category.

The Iranian framework thus reveals the complex interrelation of gender and sexuality in ways that challenge both Western transgender frameworks (which tend to distinguish gender identity from sexual orientation) and Western LGBTQ+ advocacy (which tends to treat transgender and gay/lesbian rights as parallel struggles). In Iran, transgender recognition is not allied with but rather positioned against homosexual recognition—a configuration that renders Western frameworks inadequate for understanding the lived experiences of gender-variant Iranians.

### C. Regional Variations: Turkey, Egypt, and the Gulf States

Gender variance in other MENA countries presents different configurations, reflecting distinct legal systems, colonial histories, and contemporary politics. Turkey, as a secular republic with legal frameworks derived from European models, has permitted sex reassignment surgery since 1988 and allows transgender individuals to change legal gender markers, though accessing these procedures requires diagnosis, hormone therapy, surgical intervention, and sterilization ([ILGA-Europe, 2020](https://www.ilga-europe.org/report/annual-review-2020/)). Turkey's transgender community, particularly trans women (*travesti*), has a visible presence in urban areas, though facing significant discrimination, violence, and marginalization.

Egypt represents a more restrictive context, where homosexuality is prosecuted under "debauchery" laws inherited from British colonial rule, and transgender individuals face significant social and legal obstacles. Al-Azhar University, the preeminent institution of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, has issued fatwas against sex reassignment surgery except in cases of verified intersex conditions, positioning transgender identity as distinct from and less legitimate than intersex embodiment ([Rahman, 2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13602004.2014.903206)). Egyptian transgender individuals who have obtained surgery abroad report difficulties obtaining new identity documents and face risks of prosecution.

The Gulf states present varied approaches, generally characterized by legal ambiguity and social conservatism. Same-sex acts are criminalized throughout the region, and while some countries have provisions allowing change of gender markers for intersex individuals, transgender recognition remains largely absent from legal frameworks ([ILGA World, 2020](https://ilga.org/state-sponsored-homophobia-report)).

Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa have seen some recent legal and social developments regarding LGBTQ+ issues, though transgender rights remain limited. Morocco criminalized homosexuality under post-independence reforms influenced by French colonial law, and transgender individuals face significant obstacles to legal recognition and medical care ([Human Rights Watch, 2018](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2018/country-chapters/morocco/western-sahara)).

### D. Colonial Legacies and Contemporary Politics

Understanding gender variance in MENA societies requires attention to colonial history and its ongoing effects. Many of the region's laws criminalizing same-sex acts derive not from Islamic law but from colonial-era penal codes—particularly Article 534 of the French Penal Code and Section 377 of the British Indian Penal Code, which were imposed across colonized territories ([Human Rights Watch, 2008](https://www.hrw.org/report/2008/12/17/alien-legacy/origins-sodomy-laws-british-colonialism)).

This colonial genealogy complicates narratives that position MENA societies as inherently more repressive than the West regarding gender and sexuality. As scholars in postcolonial sexuality studies have documented, colonialism introduced new forms of regulation and new identity categories that restructured indigenous configurations of gender and desire. The contemporary persistence of colonial-era laws, often defended as expressions of Islamic values, represents what might be termed "colonial debris"—the sedimented effects of colonial rule that persist after formal decolonization.

The politics of gender variance in the contemporary MENA region are thus shaped by multiple, sometimes contradictory forces: indigenous religious and cultural traditions; colonial legal and epistemic legacies; nationalist projects that may either embrace or reject Western gender frameworks; globalized LGBTQ+ movements and their critics; and local forms of organizing and resistance that may not map onto Western categories. MENA transgender cinema emerges within this complex field, navigating between local and transnational frameworks while representing subjects whose lives are shaped by these intersecting forces.

### E. Conceptual Implications for Film Analysis

The historical and contemporary frameworks outlined above have significant implications for analyzing transgender representation in MENA cinema. Several key tensions structure this representational field:

**Binary vs. Non-Binary Frameworks**: Islamic jurisprudential categories operate through binary logic, seeking to resolve gender ambiguity into male or female. Contemporary Western transgender frameworks include both binary trans identities and non-binary positions that refuse categorization as either male or female. MENA transgender cinema negotiates between these frameworks, typically representing characters who seek binary transition while sometimes gesturing toward the inadequacy of binary categories.

**Medicalization and Agency**: Iran's state-sanctioned transgender framework operates through strict medicalization, positioning gender dysphoria as pathology requiring surgical cure. Western transgender movements have increasingly challenged medicalization while recognizing that access to medical transition remains important for many trans individuals. Films representing Iranian transgender experience must navigate this medicalized context while potentially critiquing its constraints.

**Gender and Sexuality Entanglement**: The Iranian framework's positioning of transgender recognition against homosexual recognition creates distinctive entanglements of gender and sexuality that differ from Western contexts where these are typically (though not always successfully) distinguished. Films representing gender-variant MENA subjects must address the complex relationship between gender identity and sexual desire in these contexts.

**Transnational Circulation and Interpretation**: MENA transgender films circulate internationally, reaching audiences who may interpret them through frameworks very different from those operating in the films' home contexts. This transnational circulation raises questions about translation, appropriation, and the politics of interpretation—questions that the films themselves sometimes explicitly thematize.

With these contextual and conceptual foundations established, we turn now to close analysis of three films that exemplify different modes of engaging with transgender representation in MENA cinema.

## IV. Film Analysis: Three Case Studies

This section provides close analysis of three films representing transgender experience in the MENA region: *Be Like Others* (Tanaz Eshaghian, 2008), *Facing Mirrors* (Negar Azarbayjani, 2011), and *Zenne Dancer* (Caner Alper and Mehmet Binay, 2012). These films were selected for their substantive engagement with transgender themes, their distinct formal and narrative approaches, and their representation of different national contexts within the region. Together, they illuminate the range of strategies through which MENA filmmakers have addressed gender variance, as well as the common challenges and tensions that structure this representational field.

### A. *Be Like Others* (Tanaz Eshaghian, 2008)

#### Context and Production

*Be Like Others* is a documentary film directed by Tanaz Eshaghian, an Iranian-American filmmaker. The film was produced for international distribution, premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008 and subsequently screening at numerous international venues including the Berlin International Film Festival and the Human Rights Watch Film Festival. This production and circulation context positions the film within Hamid Naficy's framework of "accented cinema"—made by a diasporic filmmaker negotiating between Iranian and American cultural contexts for a primarily Western festival audience ([Naficy, 2001](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691043913/an-accented-cinema)).

The film documents the experiences of individuals seeking sex reassignment surgery in Iran, focusing particularly on two subjects: Anoush, who transitions to female, and Ali (later Negar), whose transition occurs across the film's timeframe. The documentary provides unprecedented access to Iran's transgender bureaucracy, including consultations with doctors, psychologists, and religious authorities, as well as intimate depictions of the subjects' family lives and relationships.

#### Formal Analysis

Eshaghian employs observational documentary conventions, following subjects through their daily lives and medical procedures with minimal voiceover narration or explicit directorial commentary. This observational mode creates a sense of immediacy and authenticity, positioning the viewer as witness to the subjects' experiences. However, the apparent transparency of observational documentary obscures the significant editorial choices—of subjects, scenes, and framing—that shape the film's meaning.

The camera's intimate access to subjects' private moments, including scenes of physical examination and post-operative recovery, raises ethical questions about documentary representation of transgender bodies. The film includes footage that borders on the "reveal trope" identified in fiction film criticism—moments where transgender bodies are exposed as objects of visual scrutiny. While Eshaghian's documentary intent may differ from fictional exploitation, the camera's penetrating gaze reproduces similar dynamics of spectacularization.

The film intercuts personal narratives with footage of institutional authorities—doctors, psychologists, and the surgeon Dr. Bahram Mir-Jalali, who has performed thousands of sex reassignment surgeries in Iran. These institutional voices provide commentary on subjects' lives, sometimes in ways that position medical authority over patient self-understanding. Dr. Mir-Jalali's statements, in particular, reveal the medicalized logic governing Iranian transgender recognition, as when he distinguishes between "true transsexuals" deserving surgical intervention and homosexuals who inappropriately seek transition to legitimize their desires.

#### Thematic Analysis

*Be Like Others* illuminates the coercive dimensions of Iran's transgender framework with particular clarity. Several of the film's subjects explicitly articulate that they are gay men seeking transition because it represents the only legitimate path for their same-sex desires within Iranian law. This testimony complicates any celebration of Iran's transgender policies as progressive, revealing how the same framework that enables transition for some may coerce transition for others.

Anoush, the film's central subject, expresses complex and shifting feelings about her transition. In some moments she articulates authentic identification as female; in others she expresses ambivalence about surgery and mourning for her former life. These contradictions resist the neat narrative of transgender emergence that characterizes much Western transgender representation, suggesting instead the complex pressures and constraints within which Iranian gender-variant individuals make decisions about their bodies and lives.

The film's representation of family dynamics illuminates the social context of transition in Iranian society. Parents and siblings appear in several scenes, expressing varied responses ranging from gradual acceptance to outright rejection. These familial negotiations reveal how transgender transition in Iran is not merely an individual medical decision but a social process implicating extended family networks. The film shows how families manage honor and stigma, sometimes disowning transitioning members, sometimes gradually accommodating them.

#### Postcolonial Reading

Read through postcolonial critique, *Be Like Others* occupies an ambivalent position. On one hand, the film provides valuable documentation of Iranian transgender experience rarely accessible to Western audiences, humanizing subjects who might otherwise be reduced to abstractions in policy debates. The observational style allows subjects' voices and experiences to emerge without heavy-handed directorial interpretation.

On the other hand, the film's production and circulation context—diasporic filmmaker, Western festival premiere, international distribution—raises questions about its relationship to what Massad terms the "Gay International." The film may function differently for its Western festival audience than for Iranian viewers, potentially reinforcing narratives of Iranian repression that serve homonationalist purposes. The focus on individuals coerced into transition by anti-gay laws may confirm Western assumptions about Islamic barbarism, obscuring both the colonial genealogy of anti-sodomy laws and the violence transgender individuals face within Western societies.

The film's English title, *Be Like Others*, captures this ambivalence. The phrase references the pressure on gender-variant Iranians to conform—to "be like others" through either suppression of their difference or surgical transformation that brings them into line with binary gender norms. Yet the title may also function as address to the Western viewer, inviting identification with subjects whose humanity transcends cultural difference. This double address epitomizes the complex politics of transnational transgender representation.

### B. *Facing Mirrors* (Negar Azarbayjani, 2011)

#### Context and Production

*Facing Mirrors* (*Aynehaye Rooberoo*) is a narrative fiction film directed by Negar Azarbayjani, notable as the first Iranian feature film to explicitly address transgender experience. Unlike *Be Like Others*, the film was produced within Iran's domestic film industry, requiring navigation of the country's censorship apparatus. The film received limited domestic release and has circulated primarily through international film festivals, including Frameline (San Francisco's LGBTQ+ film festival) and the Seattle International Film Festival.

The production context significantly shapes the film's representational strategies. Iranian cinema operates under censorship regulations that prohibit explicit depictions of physical intimacy, require modest dress for female characters (including the Islamic headscarf), and restrict representation of content deemed contrary to Islamic values. That *Facing Mirrors* secured production and exhibition approval within this system indicates both the relative legitimacy of transgender (as opposed to homosexual) identity in Iranian discourse and the film's careful negotiation of censorship constraints.

#### Narrative and Character Analysis

The film follows two protagonists whose lives intersect: Rana, a married woman facing financial difficulties after her husband's business failure and imprisonment, and Eddie, a transgender man seeking to raise funds for surgery while evading his disapproving family. Rana, working as a taxi driver to support her family, gives Eddie a ride, and their relationship develops across the film as Rana gradually comes to understand and accept Eddie's transgender identity.

This dual-protagonist structure enables the film to explore transgender experience through the perspective of a cisgender character who stands in for the audience's potential unfamiliarity and prejudice. Rana's arc from incomprehension to acceptance provides a narrative model for audience identification and potential transformation. This pedagogical function—teaching cisgender audiences to understand and accept transgender individuals—represents a common strategy in transgender cinema, though one that risks centering cisgender experience and positioning transgender characters as objects of learning rather than full subjects.

Eddie, portrayed by female actor Shayesteh Irani, emerges as a complex character whose transgender identity is grounded in specific social relationships and personal history rather than abstract identity categories. The film depicts Eddie's estrangement from his disapproving family, his romantic relationship with a woman, and his determination to access surgery that will align his body with his gender identity. Eddie's characterization avoids both the tragic victimhood and the triumphant emergence narratives that often structure transgender representation, presenting instead a character navigating difficult circumstances with determination and vulnerability.

#### Formal Analysis

Azarbayjani employs a realist aesthetic characterized by location shooting, naturalistic lighting, and understated performances. This formal restraint contrasts with the melodramatic conventions common in Iranian popular cinema, aligning *Facing Mirrors* with the art cinema tradition that has earned Iranian filmmakers international recognition. The realist style works to normalize transgender experience, presenting Eddie's life as continuous with ordinary reality rather than as spectacle or aberration.

The film's visual style carefully negotiates censorship requirements while subtly conveying gendered embodiment. Eddie is consistently framed in ways that emphasize masculine presentation—clothing, posture, gesture—while the requirements of Iranian censorship (which would require a female actor to wear hijab) are managed through Eddie's use of masculine headwear. This visual negotiation demonstrates how censorship constraints can generate creative formal solutions, though at the cost of representing transgender masculinity through disguise rather than embodied transformation.

The titular mirrors recur as visual motif, featuring in several key scenes where characters confront their reflections. This mirror imagery evokes the phenomenology of transgender embodiment theorized by Jay Prosser—the relationship between felt sense of self and visual image of body that may constitute transgender experience ([Prosser, 1998](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/second-skins/9780231109345)). The mirrors suggest both self-recognition and alienation, capturing the complex dynamics of transgender identity formation.

#### Thematic Analysis

*Facing Mirrors* develops several thematic strands that illuminate the specific conditions of transgender life in Iran. The film depicts the bureaucratic apparatus of transgender recognition—the medical evaluations, documentation requirements, and institutional gatekeeping—that structures access to transition. Eddie's financial struggle to afford surgery highlights the class dimensions of transgender experience: while Iran subsidizes some transition-related care, significant costs remain, and economic precarity shapes transgender individuals' ability to access recognition.

The film's treatment of family represents a significant intervention in Iranian cultural discourse. Eddie's family, representing traditional values, cannot accept his transgender identity and seeks to prevent his transition. The film does not demonize the family but presents their rejection as comprehensible within their value system while clearly sympathizing with Eddie's autonomy and self-determination. This nuanced treatment navigates between Western narratives that might simply condemn traditional Iranian family structures and uncritical deference to familial authority.

The developing relationship between Rana and Eddie structures the film's emotional arc. Rana's initial discomfort with Eddie gives way to understanding and ultimately friendship, as she comes to recognize his humanity beyond her preconceptions. This trajectory might be read as assimilationist—suggesting that transgender individuals can be accepted when cisgender people come to see them as "just like us"—but the film complicates this reading by maintaining Eddie's difference and specificity rather than erasing it.

#### Postcolonial and Feminist Reading

*Facing Mirrors* offers rich material for feminist analysis, particularly regarding its representation of women's experiences and agency. Rana's narrative—an educated woman forced into service labor by her husband's failure, struggling to maintain her family while he is imprisoned—illuminates the gendered dimensions of economic precarity in Iranian society. The film positions Rana's growing acceptance of Eddie within her broader journey toward self-determination, suggesting connections between feminist and transgender struggles.

The film's production within Iran, by an Iranian woman director, complicates the dynamics identified in *Be Like Others*. Azarbayjani's position as domestic rather than diasporic filmmaker, and the film's navigation of Iranian censorship, situates it differently within transnational circuits. The film might be read as an intervention within Iranian discourse rather than (or in addition to) a representation of Iran for Western consumption.

Yet the film's primary circulation through international festivals and its limited domestic distribution raise questions about its actual audience and effects. If few Iranians have seen *Facing Mirrors*, while Western festival audiences have ready access, the film may function more to represent Iran to the West than to intervene in Iranian debates. This circulation dynamic exemplifies the structural constraints shaping MENA transgender cinema's relationship to its multiple potential audiences.

### C. *Zenne Dancer* (Caner Alper and Mehmet Binay, 2012)

#### Context and Production

*Zenne Dancer* is a Turkish narrative film directed by Caner Alper and Mehmet Binay, based on the true story of Ahmet Yıldız, a gay man killed by his father in an "honor killing" in 2008. The film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2012 and received theatrical distribution in Turkey despite controversy and some censorship challenges. Unlike the Iranian films discussed above, *Zenne Dancer* was produced within Turkey's relatively more secular and liberal cultural industry, though still navigating significant constraints around LGBTQ+ representation.

The "zenne" of the title refers to a traditional Turkish form of male belly dancer who performs feminized movements—a historical category of gender variance with roots in Ottoman culture. The film uses this historical figure to ground its contemporary narrative in Turkish cultural tradition, implicitly arguing that gender-nonconforming individuals have long existed within Turkish society rather than representing foreign importation.

#### Narrative and Character Analysis

The film follows three interconnected characters: Can, a gay man from a wealthy secular family; Ahmet, a gay Kurdish man from a conservative rural background; and Daniel, a German academic and dancer researching the *zenne* tradition. This triangulated structure enables the film to explore class, ethnic, and cultural dimensions of LGBTQ+ experience in Turkey, contrasting the relative privilege of urban secular elites with the dangers facing those from traditional backgrounds.

Daniel's presence in the narrative introduces an explicitly cross-cultural dynamic, as a Western character whose engagement with Turkish gender variance is framed as both genuine interest and potential appropriation. The film depicts Daniel's research into the *zenne* tradition and his romantic involvement with Can, positioning Western engagement with Turkish culture as complex rather than simply exploitative. Daniel's character might be read as a surrogate for the Western audience, though one whose relationship to Turkish culture is depicted as requiring negotiation rather than assuming transparent access.

Ahmet's narrative trajectory—from rural Kurdistan to cosmopolitan Istanbul, from closeted to openly gay, from son to victim of paternal violence—provides the film's emotional and political center. Based on the real Ahmet Yıldız case, this narrative strand addresses the specific phenomenon of "honor killing" targeting LGBTQ+ individuals in Turkey and the broader Middle East. The film does not depict the murder itself but represents the mounting danger Ahmet faces as his family discovers his sexuality.

#### Formal Analysis

*Zenne Dancer* employs a more polished, commercially oriented aesthetic than the Iranian films discussed above, with professional production values, glossy cinematography, and a prominent musical score. The film incorporates sequences of dance performance that showcase the *zenne* tradition, providing visual pleasure while also representing gender-nonconforming cultural expression. These dance sequences function similarly to musical numbers in classic Hollywood cinema, providing spectacle that exceeds narrative motivation while also carrying thematic significance.

The film's visual treatment of Istanbul emphasizes the city's cosmopolitan modernity—nightclubs, art galleries, contemporary apartments—contrasting with the rural spaces associated with traditional conservatism. This urban/rural dichotomy risks reproducing Orientalist tropes that position tradition as backward and modernity as liberation, though the film complicates this binary by depicting violence and prejudice in urban spaces as well.

The film's representation of sexuality is more explicit than possible within Iranian censorship, including scenes of male intimacy that would be prohibited in Iran. This relative explicitness marks Turkey's different regulatory context while also potentially contributing to the film's marketability for international LGBTQ+ film festivals. The film occupies a distinct position within MENA cinema, neither as constrained as Iranian production nor as unrestricted as European filmmaking.

#### Thematic Analysis

*Zenne Dancer* engages with the phenomenon of honor-based violence against LGBTQ+ individuals, a significant issue in Turkey and across the MENA region. The film depicts Ahmet's family's discovery of his sexuality as initiating a process that culminates in his murder, representing honor killing as the extreme endpoint of homophobic family dynamics. This representation serves to document and condemn a practice that claims lives annually in Turkey.

However, the film's treatment of honor killing requires careful analysis from a postcolonial perspective. Critics have noted that Western discourse on honor killing often functions to position Muslim and Middle Eastern societies as uniquely barbaric, obscuring forms of anti-LGBTQ+ violence prevalent in Western societies while justifying civilizational hierarchies ([Abu-Lughod, 2013](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674725164)). *Zenne Dancer* navigates this terrain by situating honor killing within specifically Turkish contexts—Kurdish ethnicity, rural-urban migration, class dynamics—rather than presenting it as simply Islamic or Middle Eastern.

The film's mobilization of the *zenne* tradition serves an important historiographic function, demonstrating that gender-variant cultural practices have indigenous roots in Turkish/Ottoman society. This historical argument counters claims that LGBTQ+ identities are Western imports, instead positioning contemporary queer Turks as inheritors of local traditions. At the same time, the film's romanticization of the *zenne* figure risks nostalgizing historical gender variance in ways that may not accurately represent the lived experiences of historical *zenne* dancers.

The film's international co-production context and festival circulation raise familiar questions about audience and address. While *Zenne Dancer* received some Turkish theatrical distribution, its primary circulation has been through international LGBTQ+ and human rights film festivals. This circulation may shape the film's meaning, positioning it as evidence of Turkish homophobia for Western audiences rather than (or in addition to) an intervention in Turkish debates.

#### Comparative Analysis: Transgender vs. Gay Representation

While *Zenne Dancer* focuses primarily on gay male experience rather than transgender identity per se, its representation of the *zenne* figure and its attention to gender variance in Turkish culture make it relevant to this study. The film illuminates the complex relationship between transgender and homosexual identities in MENA contexts—a relationship configured differently than in Western frameworks where these categories are typically distinguished.

The *zenne* figure—a male-bodied person performing feminized dance—does not map neatly onto Western categories of drag, transgender identity, or effeminate homosexuality. Historical *zenne* dancers occupied a culturally specific position within Ottoman society that preceded and differs from contemporary identity categories. The film's representation of this figure thus engages with questions of cultural translation and historical continuity that are central to understanding gender variance in MENA contexts.

### D. Comparative Analysis Across Films

Analyzing these three films together reveals both common dynamics and significant differences in how MENA cinema represents transgender and gender-variant experience.

**Table 1: Comparative Overview of Films**

| Aspect | *Be Like Others* (2008) | *Facing Mirrors* (2011) | *Zenne Dancer* (2012) |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Country** | Iran | Iran | Turkey |
| **Format** | Documentary | Narrative fiction | Narrative fiction |
| **Director** | Tanaz Eshaghian (diasporic) | Negar Azarbayjani (domestic) | Alper & Binay (domestic) |
| **Primary Subjects** | Trans women, trans men | Trans man | Gay men, *zenne* dancer |
| **Narrative Focus** | Medical transition process | Relationship across difference | Honor killing, cultural history |
| **Circulation** | International festivals | International festivals | Festivals + Turkish theatrical |
| **Censorship Context** | Produced outside Iran | Navigated Iranian censorship | Navigated Turkish regulation |

**Table 2: Thematic Elements Across Films**

| Theme | *Be Like Others* | *Facing Mirrors* | *Zenne Dancer* |
|-------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Family Conflict** | Central | Central | Central |
| **Medical Framework** | Depicted extensively | Referenced | Absent |
| **Class Dynamics** | Present | Central | Central |
| **State Violence** | Indirect | Implicit | Addressed |
| **Historical Grounding** | Absent | Absent | Central (*zenne* tradition) |
| **Romantic Relationships** | Peripheral | Central (Eddie's partner) | Central |
| **Fatal Outcome** | None depicted | None | Based on real murder |

#### Common Dynamics

All three films depict family conflict as central to gender-variant experience in MENA societies. Unlike Western narratives that may focus on individual identity formation or medical transition as primarily personal journeys, these films position family as the crucial site of negotiation, acceptance, or rejection. This emphasis reflects the continuing importance of extended family networks in MENA societies and the ways that gender variance implicates not merely individuals but their familial and social networks.

All three films circulate primarily through international film festivals, raising common questions about transnational address and potential appropriation. Whether made by diasporic or domestic filmmakers, these films reach Western audiences who may interpret them through frameworks different from those operating in the films' home contexts. This circulation dynamic shapes both the films' production (filmmakers anticipating international audiences) and reception (Western viewers interpreting MENA subjects through their own frameworks).

All three films navigate between local and global frameworks for understanding gender variance. Whether depicting Iran's distinctive medicalized transgender recognition, Turkey's secular modernity and traditional conservatism, or the tension between indigenous categories (*khuntha*, *mukhannathun*, *zenne*) and contemporary identity labels, these films engage with the question of how to represent gender variance across cultural difference.

#### Significant Differences

The films differ significantly in their formal strategies. *Be Like Others* employs observational documentary conventions that claim transparent access to subjects' lives, while *Facing Mirrors* and *Zenne Dancer* use narrative fiction to construct characters and storylines. These different formal approaches carry different epistemological and political implications—documentary's claim to reality versus fiction's acknowledgment of construction.

The films differ in their relationship to state power and censorship. *Be Like Others*, produced outside Iran for international distribution, could represent aspects of Iranian transgender experience unavailable to domestic production. *Facing Mirrors*, navigating Iranian censorship, developed formal strategies to represent transgender identity within regulatory constraints. *Zenne Dancer*, operating within Turkey's different regulatory environment, could represent sexuality more explicitly while still facing challenges to its distribution.

The films differ in their treatment of the gender/sexuality relationship. *Be Like Others* explicitly addresses the coercive entanglement of transgender recognition and homosexuality suppression in Iran. *Facing Mirrors* focuses on transgender identity while depicting Eddie's relationship with a woman, thus representing transgender heterosexuality. *Zenne Dancer* focuses primarily on gay male experience while touching on gender variance through the *zenne* figure. These different treatments reflect both the different primary concerns of each film and the different configurations of gender and sexuality in Iranian versus Turkish contexts.

## V. Theoretical Synthesis: What MENA Transgender Cinema Reveals

The preceding analyses of *Be Like Others*, *Facing Mirrors*, and *Zenne Dancer* provide empirical grounding for broader theoretical reflection on transgender representation, transnational circulation, and the politics of visibility. This section synthesizes findings from the film analyses to address the central questions motivating this study: How do MENA filmmakers negotiate between Western transgender frameworks and local conceptualizations of gender variance? What does MENA transgender cinema contribute to broader debates about gender, representation, and postcolonial critique?

### A. The Limits of Western Transgender Frameworks

The films examined in this study reveal significant limitations in applying Euro-American transgender theory to MENA contexts without substantial modification. Several key areas of disjuncture emerge:

**Binary vs. Non-Binary Frameworks**: Contemporary Western transgender discourse has increasingly embraced non-binary identities that refuse categorization as either male or female. Organizations, legal systems, and cultural representations in North America and Europe have begun to accommodate gender-neutral pronouns, non-binary gender markers on identity documents, and identities that exceed binary classification.

The MENA contexts depicted in these films operate according to different logics. Iran's transgender recognition system requires binary identification and full surgical transition—there is no space within this framework for non-binary identity or non-operative transgender individuals. The films consistently depict characters seeking transition from one binary gender to another, reflecting the frameworks available within their social contexts rather than the full range of gender positions recognized in contemporary Western discourse.

This observation does not mean that non-binary gender positions are "Western" while MENA societies are "naturally" binary. Rather, it suggests that the specific configurations of gender recognition—what positions are available, how they are institutionalized, what resources and constraints accompany them—differ across cultural and legal contexts. As Butler's work on gender performativity suggests, the categories available for gender identification are themselves products of regulatory regimes that vary across societies ([Butler, 1990](https://www.routledge.com/Gender-Trouble-Feminism-and-the-Subversion-of-Identity/Butler/p/book/9780415389556)).

**Medicalization Debates**: Western transgender activism has mounted significant challenges to the medicalization of transgender identity—the requirement that transgender individuals obtain psychiatric diagnosis to access medical transition and legal recognition. Activists and scholars have argued that pathologization frames transgender identity as mental illness, positions medical professionals as gatekeepers of gender recognition, and excludes those who cannot or choose not to pursue medical transition ([Spade, 2011](https://www.southendpress.org/book/normal-life-administrative-violence-critical-trans-politics-and-the-limits-of-law/)).

Iran's framework represents an extreme version of medicalization, requiring formal diagnosis of "gender identity disorder," psychological evaluation, hormone treatment, and surgical intervention for legal gender recognition. The films depict this medical apparatus extensively: consultations with psychologists and surgeons, physical examinations, post-operative recovery. Within this context, the Western critique of medicalization may appear as privileged position inaccessible to those for whom medical recognition provides the only path to legitimate existence.

This does not mean medicalization should not be criticized—the films themselves, particularly *Be Like Others*, document the coercive dimensions of Iran's medical framework. Rather, it suggests that critiques of medicalization must attend to the specific contexts in which medicalization operates. What enables recognition in one context may constrain it in another; what appears as gatekeeping from one perspective may appear as protection from another.

**Individual vs. Relational Identity**: Western transgender discourse has increasingly emphasized individual self-identification as the criterion for gender recognition—the principle that individuals should be recognized as the gender they identify as, without external verification. This emphasis on individual self-determination reflects broader liberal values privileging autonomy and privacy.

The MENA contexts depicted in these films present gender identity as fundamentally relational rather than individual. Characters' gender positions are negotiated through family relationships, religious authorities, medical professionals, and state bureaucracies. Eddie in *Facing Mirrors* cannot simply declare his gender identity; he must navigate institutional gatekeepers and familial expectations. Ahmet in *Zenne Dancer* faces deadly consequences from family members who refuse to accept his sexuality. The subjects of *Be Like Others* describe their decisions about transition in relation to family honor, economic circumstances, and religious law.

This relational dimension does not mean MENA individuals lack authentic gender identities that they experience as their own. Rather, it suggests that the Western liberal model of individual self-determination may not adequately capture how gender identity is lived in contexts where family, religion, and state play more central roles in constituting subjects. As Saba Mahmood argues in her critique of liberal feminist assumptions about agency, the equation of agency with resistance to social norms may obscure how subjects in non-liberal contexts may experience self-realization through rather than against normative frameworks ([Mahmood, 2005](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691149806/politics-of-piety)).

### B. Postcolonial Critique and the Politics of Representation

The films examined in this study illuminate the complex politics of representing MENA gender variance for transnational audiences. Several dynamics merit attention:

**The "Ethnographic Gaze"**: Shohat and Stam's concept of the "ethnographic gaze" describes how Western cinema has historically positioned non-Western subjects as objects of anthropological curiosity—exotic others to be observed, classified, and understood by Western viewers ([Shohat & Stam, 1994](https://www.routledge.com/Unthinking-Eurocentrism-Multiculturalism-and-the-Media/Shohat-Stam/p/book/9780415063258)). This gaze structures not only overtly Orientalist cinema but also well-intentioned documentary and art cinema that claims to represent non-Western realities for Western audiences.

MENA transgender cinema risks reproducing the ethnographic gaze, offering Western festival audiences views into the "strange" world of Iranian transgender recognition or Turkish honor killing. *Be Like Others* is particularly vulnerable to this dynamic, providing documentary access to medical examinations and personal testimonies that may be consumed as anthropological spectacle. The film's observational style—the camera that "merely" records what unfolds before it—can obscure the power dynamics structuring what and how the film shows.

Yet the films also complicate and potentially resist the ethnographic gaze. *Facing Mirrors*, by employing fiction rather than documentary, acknowledges the constructedness of its representation rather than claiming transparent access to reality. *Zenne Dancer*, by including Western characters whose relationship to Turkish culture is itself thematized, foregrounds the dynamics of cross-cultural representation rather than assuming transparent access.

**Homonationalism and Its Discontents**: Jasbir Puar's concept of homonationalism describes how certain Western states have incorporated LGBTQ+ acceptance into nationalist projects, positioning sexual progressivism as marker of civilizational superiority against the purported homophobia of Muslim societies ([Puar, 2007](https://www.dukeupress.edu/terrorist-assemblages)). Films depicting the persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals in MENA countries may be mobilized within homonationalist discourse as evidence justifying Western intervention or confirming Western superiority.

The films examined here present complex terrain for homonationalist appropriation. They document real violence and persecution—coercive transition, honor killing, family rejection—that demands acknowledgment and response. To ignore this violence for fear of confirming Orientalist stereotypes would be its own form of violence, erasing the experiences of those who suffer.

Yet the films also complicate simplistic narratives of MENA barbarism and Western enlightenment. *Be Like Others* documents a framework of transgender recognition that, for all its problems, provides legal and medical support unavailable in many Western countries until recently (and still unavailable in some). *Zenne Dancer* situates honor killing within specific contexts—Kurdish ethnicity, rural-urban migration, class dynamics—rather than presenting it as simply Islamic. *Facing Mirrors* depicts an Iranian society capable of producing sympathetic representation of transgender experience, challenging assumptions about monolithic intolerance.

**The Problem of Comparison**: Postcolonial critique has identified how Western frameworks often position non-Western societies as "behind" on a developmental timeline that leads inevitably toward Western modernity. This temporal logic—what Dipesh Chakrabarty calls "historicism"—renders non-Western societies as "not yet" having achieved what the West already has, denying their coevalness and positioning Western modernity as universal destination ([Chakrabarty, 2000](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691130019/provincializing-europe)).

Applied to transgender recognition, this logic would position Iran's coercive medicalization as an earlier stage that will eventually give way to the self-determination model currently emerging in some Western countries. Yet such a teleology ignores how Western frameworks have their own problems—continuing gatekeeping, uneven access across class and race, violence against transgender individuals—and how MENA frameworks may have features worth preserving rather than simply transcending.

The films invite comparison without necessarily endorsing developmental narratives. By documenting specific configurations of gender recognition in Iran and Turkey, they enable viewers to see these as distinct systems rather than as "behind" Western frameworks. At the same time, the films' circulation through Western festivals may position them within narratives of MENA backwardness regardless of filmmakers' intentions.

### C. Cinema as Site of Cultural Negotiation

Beyond representation, the films examined in this study reveal cinema as a site where cultural meanings of gender are actively negotiated rather than merely reflected. Teresa de Lauretis's concept of "technologies of gender" proves particularly useful here: cinema does not simply represent pre-existing gender categories but participates in constituting the categories through which gender is understood ([de Lauretis, 1987](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1354430)).

**Generating Visibility**: For marginalized populations, media representation serves what Richard Dyer calls a "reality function"—establishing that such people exist and providing images through which they can be recognized and potentially identify ([Dyer, 2002](https://www.routledge.com/The-Matter-of-Images-Essays-on-Representation/Dyer/p/book/9780415254953)). MENA transgender cinema generates visibility for populations that may be invisible or visible only through stigmatizing representations in their home contexts.

This visibility is ambivalent, as critics of the "politics of visibility" have noted. Visibility can serve surveillance and control as well as recognition and solidarity. The visibility generated by *Be Like Others* may document coercive practices but also exposes individuals to identification and potential targeting. The visibility of Iranian transgender individuals through international media may serve Western political agendas—including regime change advocacy—rather than the interests of those individuals themselves.

Yet for transgender viewers in MENA countries with limited access to representation, these films may provide crucial resources for self-understanding and identification. Anecdotal evidence suggests that *Facing Mirrors* has been circulated informally in Iran despite limited official distribution, reaching viewers who find in it rare representation of their experiences. This informal circulation indicates how films may exceed their intended distribution channels to serve unexpected audiences.

**Negotiating Categories**: The films engage in what might be termed "categorical negotiation"—the work of representing experiences that exceed available identity categories while necessarily using those categories. The subjects of *Be Like Others* do not simply exemplify "transgender identity" as defined in Western discourse; their experiences include elements that map onto transgender categories (identification with gender other than assigned at birth) and elements that exceed or trouble those categories (transition as means to legitimate same-sex desire, ambivalence about transition, family pressures).

This categorical negotiation is most visible in *Zenne Dancer*'s representation of the *zenne* figure. The historical *zenne* dancer does not map onto contemporary categories of transgender identity, drag performance, or gay effeminacy—yet the film mobilizes this figure to claim indigenous cultural space for gender variance. This mobilization involves both honoring historical difference and potentially appropriating it for contemporary identity politics.

The films thus reveal identity categories themselves as objects of cultural work—not fixed frameworks to be applied but flexible resources to be negotiated. This insight aligns with constructionist approaches in transgender studies while also highlighting the specific dynamics of transnational categorical negotiation.

### D. Production, Circulation, and Reception Contexts

The meaning of MENA transgender cinema cannot be separated from its contexts of production, circulation, and reception. These material contexts shape both what can be represented and how representations are interpreted.

**Table 3: Production and Circulation Contexts**

| Film | Production Context | Primary Circulation | Target Audience |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| *Be Like Others* | Iranian-American filmmaker, international production | International festivals, broadcast (BBC, HBO) | Western art cinema audiences |
| *Facing Mirrors* | Iranian domestic production, navigated censorship | International festivals, limited Iranian release | Dual: Iranian domestic + international festival |
| *Zenne Dancer* | Turkish domestic production | Berlin premiere, Turkish theatrical + festivals | Turkish domestic + international festival |

**Production Constraints**: Iranian censorship regulations fundamentally shape what can be represented in domestic film production. *Facing Mirrors* developed formal strategies—Eddie's masculine headwear managing hijab requirements, circumspect treatment of sexuality—that enabled its production within the censorship system. These constraints produced a film different from what might have been possible outside Iranian regulation, yet also one that could (limitedly) circulate within Iran.

*Be Like Others*, produced outside Iran's censorship system, could represent aspects of Iranian transgender experience unavailable to domestic production—intimate medical examinations, explicit discussion of sexuality and transition. Yet this freedom came at the cost of domestic circulation: the film has never been officially released in Iran. The diasporic filmmaker thus faces a trade-off between representational freedom and domestic audience access.

**Festival Circulation**: All three films have circulated primarily through international film festivals—Sundance, Berlin, Frameline, and others. This festival circulation positions the films within specific interpretive frameworks: the art cinema tradition with its emphasis on auteurism and national cinema; the human rights film tradition with its emphasis on documentation and advocacy; the LGBTQ+ film tradition with its emphasis on community representation and political engagement.

These frameworks shape how films are received. *Be Like Others* at Sundance is positioned differently than it would be at a human rights festival or LGBTQ+ festival—the same film read through different interpretive frameworks. The films' meanings are thus not fixed by their texts but negotiated through their circulation contexts.

**Audience Positioning**: The films' transnational circulation creates split audiences with different relationships to the films' content. Western festival audiences approach these films as representations of elsewhere—an Iran or Turkey they have not experienced, populated by subjects with whom they may or may not identify. Iranian or Turkish viewers who access these films—officially or informally—approach them as representations of their own societies, potentially recognizing themselves or their communities.

This split audience creates interpretive dilemmas. Should the films prioritize accuracy for domestic audiences who can assess their verisimilitude, or accessibility for international audiences unfamiliar with the contexts depicted? Should they challenge domestic prejudices or international stereotypes? The films negotiate these competing demands differently, with *Facing Mirrors* perhaps most oriented toward domestic audiences and *Be Like Others* most toward international audiences.

### E. Toward a Transnational Transgender Cinema Studies

The analysis developed in this paper suggests the need for approaches to transgender cinema that can accommodate transnational dynamics without either imposing Western frameworks or essentializing non-Western difference. Several principles emerge:

**Contextual Specificity**: Transgender representation must be analyzed within the specific legal, medical, religious, and cultural contexts in which it is produced and received. Iranian transgender cinema operates under different conditions than Turkish, Egyptian, or Moroccan cinema; generalizations about "MENA transgender cinema" must remain attentive to these differences.

**Multiple Audiences**: Transnational cinema addresses multiple audiences who bring different interpretive frameworks and different stakes to their viewing. Analysis must attend to how films negotiate between these audiences rather than assuming a unified spectator position.

**Productive Tension**: The tension between Western transgender frameworks and MENA configurations of gender variance is not a problem to be resolved but a productive site for theoretical elaboration. What MENA cinema reveals about the limits of Western frameworks is as valuable as what Western frameworks illuminate about MENA cinema.

**Beyond Comparison**: Analysis should resist positioning MENA societies as "behind" Western societies on a developmental timeline of transgender recognition. Different configurations of gender, sexuality, and recognition represent different orderings of social life, each with its own possibilities and constraints.

**Material Conditions**: Transgender representation cannot be separated from material conditions of production, circulation, and reception. Who makes these films, under what constraints, for what audiences, and through what distribution channels—these material factors fundamentally shape representational possibilities.

## VI. Conclusion

This study has examined transgender representation in Middle Eastern and North African cinema through close analysis of three films—*Be Like Others* (2008), *Facing Mirrors* (2011), and *Zenne Dancer* (2012)—situated within broader theoretical frameworks from transgender studies, film theory, and postcolonial critique. The analysis reveals MENA transgender cinema as a complex site where competing conceptualizations of gender, sexuality, and identity are negotiated across cultural, linguistic, and geopolitical boundaries.

### Summary of Findings

The films examined in this study demonstrate several key dynamics:

**1. Local Frameworks for Gender Variance**: MENA societies have historically developed frameworks for conceptualizing gender variance—*khuntha* in Islamic jurisprudence, *mukhannathun* in early Islamic social history, *zenne* dancers in Ottoman culture—that differ from and predate Western transgender categories. Contemporary MENA transgender cinema negotiates between these local frameworks and globalized identity categories, neither simply applying Western frameworks nor preserving indigenous categories unchanged.

**2. The Iranian Paradox**: Iran's unique legal configuration—permitting transgender recognition while criminalizing homosexuality—produces distinctive dynamics that challenge Western assumptions about the relationship between transgender and gay/lesbian rights. The films document both the possibilities this framework creates for transgender recognition and its coercive effects on individuals whose gender variance may be entangled with same-sex desire. This paradox reveals the culturally contingent nature of the gender/sexuality relationship rather than its universal configuration.

**3. Transnational Circulation and Interpretation**: MENA transgender films circulate primarily through international film festivals, reaching audiences who may interpret them through frameworks different from those operating in the films' home contexts. This transnational circulation raises questions about representation, appropriation, and the politics of visibility that the films themselves negotiate to varying degrees. The split between domestic and international audiences creates interpretive dilemmas without easy resolution.

**4. Cinema as Technology of Gender**: Following de Lauretis, the films demonstrate cinema's role in constituting rather than merely reflecting gender categories. By generating visibility for transgender subjects, negotiating between available identity categories, and circulating across cultural boundaries, MENA transgender cinema participates in the ongoing cultural work of defining what gender variance means and how it should be understood.

**5. Postcolonial Dynamics**: The films invite postcolonial analysis that attends to how gender and sexual identity categories circulate within structures of global power. Neither simply imposing Western frameworks nor retreating to untouched indigenous categories, the films reveal the complex negotiations through which gender variance is represented in postcolonial contexts. Massad's critique of the "Gay International" and Puar's analysis of homonationalism provide essential tools for understanding how these representations may be appropriated within dominant political projects while also potentially resisting such appropriation.

### Contributions to Scholarship

This study contributes to several scholarly conversations:

**To Transgender Studies**: The analysis demonstrates the limits of Euro-American transgender theory when applied to non-Western contexts, while also revealing productive tensions that can advance theoretical elaboration. The Iranian case, in particular, challenges assumptions about the relationship between transgender recognition and broader LGBTQ+ rights, suggesting that different configurations are possible. The emphasis on relational rather than individual identity formation, and on family as central site of gender negotiation, offers correctives to individualist liberal frameworks.

**To Film Studies**: The analysis extends queer cinema theory to encompass MENA transgender representation, examining how familiar representational dynamics—the reveal trope, the male gaze, the politics of visibility—operate in different cultural contexts. The attention to transnational circulation and multiple audiences develops frameworks for analyzing cinema that addresses disparate interpretive communities simultaneously.

**To Postcolonial Studies**: The analysis applies postcolonial critique to transgender representation, an intersection that remains underdeveloped in the scholarly literature. The films examined here provide concrete case studies for theorizing how gender and sexual identity categories circulate within postcolonial contexts, neither entirely Western imports nor timeless indigenous formations.

**To Middle Eastern and North African Studies**: The analysis contributes to understanding of gender, sexuality, and culture in the MENA region, examining how contemporary cultural production represents and negotiates gender variance. The attention to historical Islamic categories provides context often missing from studies focused exclusively on contemporary identity politics.

### Limitations and Future Directions

This study is necessarily limited in scope. The focus on three films from two countries (Iran and Turkey) cannot represent the full diversity of MENA transgender cinema or of gender variance across the region's many societies. Future research should examine:

**Additional National Contexts**: Transgender representation in cinema from Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, and other MENA countries may reveal different dynamics shaped by distinct legal, cultural, and production contexts. Comparative analysis across a broader range of national cinemas would illuminate regional patterns and variations.

**Non-Film Media**: This study focuses on feature-length film, but transgender representation circulates through many media—short films, online video, television, social media. Analysis of these media would reveal different representational possibilities and different patterns of circulation and reception.

**Reception Studies**: This study analyzes films' textual dynamics and their production/circulation contexts, but does not conduct empirical research on how actual audiences interpret these films. Reception studies examining how Iranian, Turkish, and Western audiences engage with these films would provide crucial evidence about the interpretive processes this study can only theorize.

**Transgender Filmmakers and Subjects**: The films examined here are directed by cisgender filmmakers. Research foregrounding transgender filmmakers and the perspectives of transgender subjects would provide essential correctives to outsider perspectives that necessarily shape this analysis.

**Historical Analysis**: While this study attends to historical frameworks for gender variance in Islamic societies, it focuses primarily on contemporary cinema. More extensive historical analysis—of earlier representations of gender variance in MENA visual culture, of changing configurations over time—would provide important context for understanding contemporary dynamics.

### Concluding Reflections

This study began with a set of questions about how MENA filmmakers negotiate between Western transgender frameworks and local conceptualizations of gender variance. The analysis reveals that this negotiation is neither simple application nor simple rejection of Western frameworks, but a complex process of translation, adaptation, and contestation. The films examined here appropriate Western categories while also transforming them, mobilize local frameworks while also updating them, and generate new configurations that cannot be fully captured by either Western or indigenous vocabularies.

The significance of MENA transgender cinema lies not merely in its representational content—the images of transgender individuals it provides—but in the cultural work it performs. By bringing transgender experience into visibility, by negotiating between available frameworks for understanding gender variance, by circulating across cultural boundaries and addressing multiple audiences, these films participate in the ongoing construction of what gender variance means in an interconnected world.

This cultural work is inevitably political. The films document real violence, coercion, and exclusion; they also document possibility, survival, and transformation. They may be appropriated for projects their makers do not endorse; they may also reach audiences who find in them resources for understanding their own experiences or transforming their attitudes toward others. The meanings they generate are not fixed by their makers' intentions but negotiated through their circulation and reception across diverse contexts.

For scholars, the task is to analyze these dynamics with care and humility—recognizing that our own interpretive frameworks are shaped by our positions within global structures of power, attending to what the films reveal about the limits of our theoretical frameworks, and remaining open to what they might teach us about gender, sexuality, identity, and difference. The films examined here suggest that such analysis can be generative, producing insights that advance theoretical understanding while also illuminating the lived experiences and cultural productions of transgender and gender-variant individuals in the MENA region and beyond.
